A personalised Resume Analyser in which the uploaded resume is analysed(the text is read using parsing) and a score is given for the resume
and also the perfect profession is analysed(knn algo is used for decision making) based on the user's done courses and interested languages and gives suggestions on what to do next,
or what future actions can be done. There is also an option for the admin side where all the analysed resume's can be seen and the admin can then use some of the 
individuals for recruitment or even for interview
